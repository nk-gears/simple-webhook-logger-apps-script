# Simple Webhook Looger - For Development and Debugging Purposes

I have benn using some external services for Logging the webhook. I like the RequestBin, PipeDream.io. But all these external services seems to have some limits and has some throtlling issues in the basic plan.

So created this simple utility using App Script and it's more reliable and works well.
